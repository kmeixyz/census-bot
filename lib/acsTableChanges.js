// lib/acsTableChanges.js
//
// Hand-curated catalog of documented ACS table-level changes. Census
// publishes "Table and Geography Changes" pages each release year, but the
// formatting is irregular (PDF / inline HTML / footnotes), making automated
// scraping fragile. This file is the pragmatic alternative: a small,
// reviewable JSON-shaped record keyed by table id, listing the years a
// table was redesigned and a one-line description of what changed.
//
// Used by:
//   • The trend pipeline's concept-shift detection (lib/sourcing.js +
//     pages/api/trend.js) — when a series spans a documented redesign year,
//     the warning becomes specific ("table redesigned in 2022, sub-category
//     definitions changed") instead of generic ("values jumped 50×").
//   • Source-trail nuances — when a stat or trend cites a redesigned table,
//     a banner cites the redesign so users reading historical context know
//     to compare cautiously.
//
// SOURCING POLICY: Every entry MUST cite the Census Bureau publication or
// announcement. Don't add entries from blog posts, news, or memory. When a
// new redesign is documented, add a record here and link the source.
//
// Sources:
//   • https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/table-and-geography-changes.html
//   • Year-specific "What's New" pages on census.gov
